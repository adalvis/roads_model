# WADNR Roads Project Model
Driver for testing and tutorials for learning the distributed roads 
model components being developed/are already developed in Landlab.

## First component: `TruckPassErosion`
Calculate sediment depths for forest road cross section layers based
on traffic-induced, erosion-enhancing processes: pumping, crushing,
scattering (and by default, flow rerouting).

## Second component: `FlowAccumulator` or `KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow`
Route flow over the forest road surface. Which component is chosen depends on 
the timestep of rainfall/runoff being fed to the model. `FlowAccumulator` works
best for a coarser timestep, whereas `KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow` works best for
a finer timestep. However, `FlowAccumulator` is a much faster flow router than
`KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow`.

## Third component: `FastscapeEroder`
