# WADNR Roads Project Distributed Model
**Updated:** 09/24/2025

## Summary
This repository contains drivers for testing and tutorials for learning the distributed roads 
model components that are being developed/are already developed in Landlab.

## Model component descriptions
### First component: `TruckPassErosion`
Calculates sediment depths for forest road cross section layers based
on traffic-induced, erosion-enhancing processes: pumping, crushing,
scattering (and by default, flow rerouting). This is a net-zero component
(i.e., the mass balance for the whole system is 0).

### Second component: `FlowAccumulator` or `KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow`
Routes flow over the forest road surface. Which component is chosen depends on 
the timestep of rainfall/runoff being fed to the model. `FlowAccumulator` works
best for a coarser timestep, whereas `KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow` works best for
a finer timestep. However, `FlowAccumulator` is a much faster flow router than
`KinwaveImplicitOverlandFlow`.

### Third component: `FastscapeEroder`
Erodes the landscape based on a stream power framework. The erosion of each node is 
based on an erosivity value, the contributing drainage area (or flow, depending on 
how the component is initialized), and the slope.
A future iteration of this spatially distributed model will use a different erosion
component based on slightly different variables (such as roughness).

### Third component (update): `OverlandFlowTransporter`
Erodes a surface with shallow overland flow using physics-based formulations for 
entrainment and transport that can directly use sediment size distribution and surface 
roughness. The sediment transport rate is calculated using Govers' equation (1992) 
with shear stress partitioning
