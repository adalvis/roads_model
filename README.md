# WADNR Roads Project Model
Drivers for testing the distributed roads model components being developed 
in Landlab.

## First component: TruckPassErosion
Calculate sediment depths for forest road cross section layers based
on traffic-induced, erosion-enhancing processes: pumping, crushing,
scattering (and by default, flow rerouting).
